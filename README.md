# Analysis of mental health disorders around the globe 1990-2017
I wanted to do an analysis in Healthcare and one where I can use maps, so why wouldn't I do it at the same time?  
My source was Kaggle: <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder'>Global Trends in Mental Health Disorder</a>

The dataset contains the mental health series of all the countries in the following mental disorders:
- schizophrenia,
- bipolar,
- eating,
- anxiety,
- drug use,
- depression,
- alcohol use.

## The progress
Firstly, I made a plot about alcohol use disorders, since I thought it is the main concern in Hungary. It turned out, it is not. But it is a serious issue in the former USSR countries.

Secondly, I wanted to see the level of anxiety before and after the global crisis in 2008. It was the first crisis I was aware of, the first that I felt the effect of.

Then, I examined the highest and lowest disorder per country. The top ones were depression, anxiety and alcohol, eating disorders and schizophrenia were at the end of the sequence.

## Investigating Hungary and the Eastern Block
1989 was a great turning point in Hungary's history with the withdrawal of the Russian troops. Thus, I considered it to have a positive effect in mental health, and it did exert the depression and alcohol use levels positively.
Regarding these disorders, I examined them on the former members of the Eastern Block. I did not see a correlation in alcohol use, but I could see a consequent decrease in the level of depression in all the countries.

## Investigating the disorder with the greatest change during this period
When looking for the disorder which undergoes the greatest change, I could not single out one. We can see all of them but schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.

Alcohol use changed much in the former USSR, in Northern Europe and in most of the Spanish-speaking countries of South America.
Drug use disorder altered a lot in the USA and in the Arabian countries.
Depression changed much in Africa, India, Pakistan, in the Balkan, in the small Latin American countries, in France, Spain and Finland.
Anxiety's change is meaningful in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China, Italy, Somalia.

## Looking for the disorder with biggest increase per country
There is no country where only decrease has taken place.
Drug use disorders can be said the most serious increasing one. USA, Canada, Northern Africa, Middle East, Western Europe, Middle Asia are its victims.
The second one is anxiety, but it's worth taking a look at the map.

## Looking for the disorder with biggest decrease per country
The biggest decrease is even more diversified, but there are countries where only increase has happened.
These unfortunate ones are Australia, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Egypt, Indonesia, Poland, Belarus, Ireland and some others.

## Investigating the most serious change related the whole globe
Lastly, I wanted to see the most serious disorders related the whole globe.
The results are the followings:
  
| Disorder              | Change     |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Schizophrenia         | + 0.0051 % |
| Bipolar disorder      | + 0.0074 % |
| Eating disorders      | + 0.0391 % |
| Anxiety disorders     | + 0.0422 % |
| Drug use disorders    | + 0.0903 % |
| Depression            | - 0.0456 % |
| Alcohol use disorders | + 0.0369 % |
  
Lastly, I made two plots regarding to depression and drug usage, which were the most decreasing and increasing disorders when examined globally. The plot shows every countries' outcome.
