# Analysis of mental health disorders around the globe 1990-2017
I wanted to do an analysis in Healthcare and one where I can use maps, so why wouldn't I do it at the same time?
My source was Kaggle: <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder'>Global Trends in Mental Health Disorder</a>

The dataset contains the mental health series of all the countries in the following mental disorders:
- schizophrenia,
- bipolar,
- eating,
- anxiety,
- drug use,
- depression,
- alcohol use.

## The progress
Firstly, I made a plot about alcohol use disorders, since I thought it is the main concern in Hungary. It turned out, it is not. But it is a serious issue in the former USSR countries.

Secondly, I wanted to see the level of anxiety before and after the global crisis in 2008. It was the first crisis I was aware of, the first that I felt the effect of.

Then, I examined the highest and lowest disorder per country. The top ones were depression, anxiety and alcohol, eating disorders and schizophrenia were at the end of the sequence.

## Investigating Hungary and the Eastern Block
1989 was a great turning point in Hungary with the withdrawal of the Russian troops. Thus, I considered it to have a positive effect in mental health, and it did exert the depression and alcohol use levels positively.
Regarding these disorders, I examined them on the former members of the Eastern Block. I did not see a correlation in alcohol use, but I could see a consequent decrease in the level of depression in all the countries.

## Investigating the disorder with the greatest change during this period
